## Introduction
Book Buddy is a React web application that leverages a RESTful book API to create an online bookstore.

## Functionality
Upon visiting the Book Buddy user interface, visitors are welcomed to a landing page which displays an authentication navbar, along with all the books the bookstore has ever offered, below the navbar. New users can register, and returning users can log in to their existing accounts. Once authenticated, users are able to see which books are available in the store, read specific book details, and add or remove books they are interested in, or no longer interested in, from their carts.

## App Languages & Tools
The Book Buddy web app is primarily created with React JS, HTML, and CSS.
Redux Toolkit is used to manage app state and perform CRUD operations with the book API.
React Router is utilized to display the application as a single-page application, allowing seamless navigation through the app for users.
